# You're here

[anthonybronkema.com](https://www.anthonybronkema.com) is the live site.

Thanks for visiting. This is new. There will be a lot of updates. 

If you're here to provide feedback, please use the Issues so I can track my progress. 

I'm really interested in specific feedback about:

- accessibility
- style aesthetics
- style (css)
- markup errors or improvements
- anything JavaScript. I have tons to learn here.

Feel free to leave it in [issues](https://github.com/anthonybronkema/anthonybronkema/issues) (along with actual issues) on GitHub, [Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/anthonybronkema) (DM or @), or on my site's form.

Thanks in advance!
